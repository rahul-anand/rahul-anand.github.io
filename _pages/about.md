Working as as an Applied Scientist at AWS .

I finished my Ph.D thesis on [Practical network layer machine learning for IoT security](https://kilthub.cmu.edu/articles/thesis/Practical_network-layer_machine_learning_for_IoT_security/25030973/1) from Carnegie Mellon advised by [Prof. Vyas Sekar](https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~vsekar/) and [Prof. Anthony Rowe](https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~agr/).

Previously, at Microsoft Research, I was involved in the project [FarmBeats](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/farmbeats-iot-agriculture/), where I worked on developing ML algorithms on sensor data for agriculture.

 Before that, I finished my Undergrad and Masters's from IIIT Hyderabad, India. My Master's[ thesis](https://cdn.iiit.ac.in/cdn/cvit.iiit.ac.in/images/Thesis/MS/RahulAnandMS2016/Thesis.pdf) was in the field of computer vision where I developed several algorithms to analyze cricket and soccer broadcast videos.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
