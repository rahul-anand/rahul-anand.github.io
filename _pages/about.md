I have joined the Network Infrastructure team at AWS.

I finished my Ph.D thesis on [Practical network layer machine learning for IoT security](https://kilthub.cmu.edu/articles/thesis/Practical_network-layer_machine_learning_for_IoT_security/25030973/1) from Carnegie Mellon advised by [Prof. Vyas Sekar](https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~vsekar/) and [Prof. Anthony Rowe](https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~agr/).

Previously, at Microsoft Research, I was involved in the project [FarmBeats](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/farmbeats-iot-agriculture/), where I worked on developing ML algorithms on sensor data for agriculture.

 Before that, I finished my Undergrad and Masters's from IIIT Hyderabad, India. My Master's[ thesis](https://cdn.iiit.ac.in/cdn/cvit.iiit.ac.in/images/Thesis/MS/RahulAnandMS2016/Thesis.pdf) was in the field of computer vision where I developed several algorithms to analyze cricket and soccer broadcast videos.
